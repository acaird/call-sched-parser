#+TITLE: Call Schedule Parser
#+OPTIONS: ':t ^:{} author:t toc:nil


My wife's call schedule is sent out in a ridiculous Excel spreadsheet,
which does no one any good.

The Python script here parses it and prints out dates and names.  It
has a few options which you can see with the =--help= option.

The current list is below, but might be out of date.

 | Option (short, long)                         | Description                                             | Required |
 |----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+----------|
 | -y YEAR, --year YEAR                         | set the year for the calendar; defaults to this year    | no       |
 | -m MONTH, --month MONTH                      | set the month being parsed                              | yes      |
 | -f FILE, --file FILE                         | filename of xlsx file to be read                        | yes      |
 | -p PERSON, --person PERSON                   | filter results to only this person                      | no       |
 | -s [{0,1}], --summary [{0,1}]                | print summary stats for number of calls; defaults to no | no       |
 | -c CALENDARFILE, --calendarfile CALENDARFILE | filename of calendar (ics) file to write                | no       |
 | -t TEXT, --text TEXT                         | extra text to prepent to the iCal event                 | no       |

As an example of using the Python =xlrd= module, this is probably OK;
as a useful script for anyone besides me, it probably isn't OK.  Why
they can't just use a Google calendar is beyond me.
